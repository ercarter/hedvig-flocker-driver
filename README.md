# Description
Hedvig is a distributed, software-defined storage solution that leverages commodity servers to create a web-scale storage platform for any compute environment.

Using the Hedvig-Flocker driver, you can achieve persistent storage for Docker-ized applications and take advantage of Hedvig storage features such as deduplication, compression, caching, and replication. For the Docker/Flocker integration, Hedvig provides a raw virtual block disk that can be formatted using any file system and used for storing any kind of data.

**Note:** *This driver was tested with Flocker version 1.7.0.*
